-----

Replaces the original test chamber door models with the new november doors included with P2:CE!

The activated/deactived skins are set accordingly (depending on if the door is open/closed), and specific maps also use the destroyed variant!

-----

This addon is fully supported for the singleplayer campaign, and should function correctly under most circumstances in other player's workshop addons.
